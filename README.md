# COLING2018
Python code for training and testing the model in the COLING 2018 paper: "Convolutional Neural Network for Universal Sentence Embeddings". This simple CNN model achieves strong performance on semantic similarity tasks in transfer learning setting, and it can also act as effective initialization for downstream tasks.
